# Feeder Firmware

### Q. Why recreate the firmware ?

### A. Because I want the feeder to behave differently

## Todo
1 - Replicate std standalone functionality

* Advance / rewind

* Button controlled tape adavance param config


2 - in no particular order;

* Tape advance acceleration/deceleration (for those plastic tape fleas that jump out of the pocket)

* Optional delayed advance after pick-up

* Normal advance, then x steps (for those stuborn pockets)

* Fake 2mm (56 slit) indexing with 4mm (28 slit) encoder ?

* RS485 comms;
	* in feeder bay motion control (so you don't have to open the machine / put your limbs at risk)

	* configure tape advance params

	* add human readable descriptors relative to loaded tape

	* feeder readiness status for machine pick-up hold-off
